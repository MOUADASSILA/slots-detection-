Introduction:
Parking Slot Detector is a Python script that uses the OpenCV library to detect available parking slots in a video. It processes each frame of the video, identifies parking slots, and marks them as either free or occupied based on a predefined threshold. This project can be useful for parking management systems or real-time monitoring of parking lots.

Features:
-Detects available parking slots in a video.
-Visualizes free and occupied parking slots in real-time.
-Adjustable parameters such as threshold, rectangle size, and color.

Installation:
-Clone the repository
**Copy code**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-slot-detector.git
-Navigate to the project directory
**Copy code**

Usage:
-Replace video_path variable in the script with the path to your video file.
-Adjust parameters such as threshold, rect_width, rect_height, color, etc., according to your requirements.
-Run the script:
**Copy code**
python parking_slot_detector.py
